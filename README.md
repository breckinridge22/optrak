## Setting up project with Docker
- Download docker on host machine (and boot2docker if using MacOS)
- Open this directory in terminal and run `chmod +x docker/wait-for-db.sh && chmod +x docker/run-python.sh && chmod +x rundocker.sh` (only need to run once to a fresh clone of the project)
- Run `./rundocker.sh` and visit app on host machine at `localhost:8000`
